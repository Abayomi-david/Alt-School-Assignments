                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>My name is <strong>Abayomi David olamide</strong>, and I am currently a dedicated student at AltSchool Africa, where I am pursuing a backend software engineering program. My AltSchool ID is ALT/SOE/024/0516.</p>
                <p>My passion for technology drives my continuous learning journey. I joined AltSchool to acquire practical, industry-relevant skills that will equip me to become a proficient and innovative software engineer. One of my goals in the School of Engineering program is to master backend technologies, contribute to open-source projects, and secure a role as a software engineer where I can solve real-world problems.</p>
                <p>As a student, I am committed to expanding my knowledge in coding, algorithms, and system design. I actively engage in projects that challenge my thinking and improve my coding skills. I believe in the power of collaboration and often work with peers to develop solutions and learn new technologies.</p>
                <p>Beyond academics, I have a deep-seated love for learning. Whether it's exploring new programming languages, understanding different cultures, or picking up a new hobby, I am always eager to learn and grow. This curiosity fuels my drive to excel in everything I do.</p>
